## Any Way You Want It: Extending Swagger UI for Fun and Profit

This repository is for assets from my [APIStrat 2018](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018) talk on September 25, 2018 in Nashville.

### Demos

These demos are deployed alongside Swagger UI 3.19.0. Each plugin was compiled with the [BabelJS REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/) before being published to the web, so that the JSX and ES6+ syntax in each are web-compatible.
